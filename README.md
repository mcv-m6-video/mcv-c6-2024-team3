# TEAM 3: Video Surveillance for Road Project & Human Action Recognition

Welcome to the MCV-C6 project repository for video surveillance on roads & Human Action Recognition. This repository houses the code and progress of Team 3 within the C6 project of the MCV.

## About
The MCV-C6 project focuses on two main tasks: developing robust video surveillance techniques tailored for road monitoring (Weeks 1-4) and developing and experimenting with human action recognition techniques (Weeks 5 - end). This repository serves as a central hub for our team's contributions and advancements in the field.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into weekly folders, each containing the code and documentation for that particular week's tasks. Detailed instructions on running the code for each week are provided within their respective folders.

## Updates
We regularly update this repository with our latest findings, developments, and outcomes. Feel free to explore the different weeks' contributions.
